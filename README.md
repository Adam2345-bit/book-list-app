# The Book List

## Project Proposal

**What will this applicaiton do ?**

The Book List application shows the user a list of books (name and author) that the user 
wants to read. It also allows the user to mark books as read, 
add and delete books from the list.

**Who will use it?**

The Book List can be used by anyone who wants to keep track of books he/she has already read 
or wants to read in the future;


**Why is the project of interest to me ?**

This project is of interest to me, because it will encourage me and other people to read more
books by providing a convenient way to manage their book lists.

## User Stories

Phase 1
 - As a user, I want to be able to view the list of books.
 - As a user, I want to be able to add a book to my book list.
 - As a user, I want to be able to delete books from my book list.
 - As a user, I want to be able to mark a book as read/unread.

Phase 2
- As a user, I want to be able to save my list of books to a file.
- As a user, I want to be able to load my list of books from a file.

Phase 3
- (GUI only): As a user, I want to be able to view only read/unread books in a book list.

**Phase 4: Task 2**

I chose to make changeStatus method from BookList class robust. It throws checked InvalidStatusException.
Appropriate tests have been added.

**Phase 4: Task 3**

- I would have refactored BookListGuiApp class by moving fields for buttons, text fields and labels into the 3 
respective classes. I would then instantiate these classes in the BookListGuiApp class. It would have improved the SRP.
