# The Book List

## Project Proposal

**What will this applicaiton do ?**
- show a list of books that the user has already read (completed list) and wants to read (wish list);
- allow the user to add/delete books to/from the wish list;
- allow the user to mark a book as read and add/delete it to/from the completed list;
- sort books by title, author, and genre;
- see the number of books in wish and completed lists;

**Who will use it?**
- a person who wants to keep track of books he/she has already read or wants to read in the future;


**Why is the project of interest to me ?**

This project is of interest to me, because it will encourage me and other people to read more
books by providing a convenient way to manage their personal libraries.
